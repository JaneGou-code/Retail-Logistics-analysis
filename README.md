# Retail Logistics Analysis
This project will cover a retail chain with 25 offline shops and one online shop in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and New South Wales (NSW). The retail chain is considering closing two underperforming stores and opening one new store with a strategic location. While also ramping up online sales by 40% and offline stores by 15%. Furthermore, selecting the right distribution centres and routing planning are also considered to be this project's objectives.
